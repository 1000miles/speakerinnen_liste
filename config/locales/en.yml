              The Speakerinnen* List aims to increase the visibility and participation of women at (but not limited to) conferences, panels and talk shows.<br>
              Organizers and hosts can find experts, who gladly (and competently) share their knowledge. <br>
              Women can register in our database with the topics they are interested in covering, and can add references to their abilities.

      title: "About Speakerinnen*"
      text: |
            Many people don’t like it that men more often than women are invited as experts to conferences or to speak to the media.
            There is no basis for this in biology: men are not smarter than women.<br>
            Pointing out this discrepancy to organisers often gets the response is that no suitable woman was found.
            We are convinced that there are more competent women out there to take the stage.<br>
            Girls need female role-models and women need the confirmation that their option on a certain topic is just as valued as any other. Events need more diversity.<br><br>
            The Speakerinnen List sprung from an idea of several women,
            and was built as a learning project by Rubymonsters, a study group of Rails Girls Berlin.
            <a href='http://railsgirlsberlin.de', target='_blank'>Rails Girls</a> is an international not-for-profit organization,
            that aims to get women excited about programming. With workshops, study groups and scholarships, Rails Girls is an extraordinary learning community.<br>
