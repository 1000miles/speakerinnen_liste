        <strong>Why is there no speaker for the topic I am looking for?</strong>
        <span class="italic">Possibly, nobody has created a tag for this topic yet. As soon as a speaker names this topic as one of her tags, this topic becomes visible as a tag within the topic range.</span>

        <br>
        <strong>Can anybody join in?</strong><br>

        <strong>Why has my profile not been activated yet?</strong>
        <span class="italic">One of two reasons may apply: <br>a.) If your profile has just been created, it might take a bit since we're not online 24/7. <br>b.) We might have thought that your profile is a draft version because we might have had the impression that there is too little information so far. In case you mean to have it activtated as is, please drop us a line: speakerinnen@lists.riseup.net</span>

        <strong>How do I use the search function?</strong>
        <span class="italic">You can search the fields, the speakers filled in their profiles: <br> name - language - city - references - topics - biography - title <br> You can search for combinations with AND an OR, e.g. energy berlin. If you use multiple words together they will be used as AND operator by default. </span>
